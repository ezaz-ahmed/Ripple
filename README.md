# 🌊 Ripple

**Ripple** is an open-source social media app built with **FastAPI**, **Python**, and **SQL**.

> Every post makes a ripple. 🌊

## 🚀 Overview

Ripple is a modern micro-posting platform that allows users to:

- Post short messages ("ripples")
- View others’ posts in a feed
- Follow and interact with other users

## 🧠 Purpose

**Ripple** is a personal learning project created to help me **master backend development with Python**.  
Through building this app, I aim to gain hands-on experience with:

- **FastAPI**
- **SQL & Database Design**
- **Authentication & API Design**
- **CRUD Operations**
- **Testing**
- **Logging & Monitoring**
- **Docker & Containerization**
- **Documentation**

> This project serves as both a personal learning journey and a foundation for exploring advanced backend development concepts.

## 📖 Documentation

Ripple includes interactive API documentation powered by **FastAPI**.  
Once the development server is running, you can explore and test the endpoints directly in your browser:

- **Swagger UI:** [http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs)
- **ReDoc:** [http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc](http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc)

Additional developer documentation — including architecture notes, design decisions, and contribution guidelines — will be added in the `/docs` directory as the project evolves.
